Hoffman explains how he was first pitched on Airbnb:\n\n\u201cOh, I got this really exciting investment and I think it\u2019s really, really, really interesting and I\u2019m looking to make an investment in it myself. It\u2019s Airbnb.\u201d And I go like, what\u2019s that? \u201cWell, it\u2019s renting couches, you know, everyone has couches and now every space opens up because you can rent a couch.\u201d That was essentially how I was pitched on it. I was like okay, if it\u2019s essentially a couch thing, don\u2019t talk to me about it. And the reason was couches have all of the downsides and\n\n15 Ibid.\n\n16 \u201cHow I Built It\u201d with Guy Raz, Airbnb: Joe Gebbia, NPR, August 28, 2017.\n\n17 \u201cAirbnb,\u201d Fast Company, February 7, 2012.\n\n18 Fireside chat with Alfred Lin and Bambi Francisco, Post-Seed Conference, San Francisco, December 5, 2015.\n\n19 Reid Hoffman is a famous American entrepreneur and venture capitalist.

At that point, we really started investigating, well, do we think this strategy is going to\n    work. And it became clear that there was one thing they did that worked very well, and that one\n    thing was that they actually had local people and local offices on the ground. We tested it ourselves\n    and we realized, oh crap \u2013 that actually works!\n    ... I end up going to Berlin in 2011, met with Samwer and\u2026 we realized that we had a decision to\n    make, and the decision was [between] Plan A and what we called Plan B. And Plan A was we retain\n    this global travel network by acquiring Wimdu. Because we visited them and they clearly had a ton\n    of traction. Or, we had Plan B. The problem is, we didn\u2019t know what Plan B was yet. And, we\u2019re\n    like, OK, we have to come up with plan B. And, even that night, we decided to do Plan B.
