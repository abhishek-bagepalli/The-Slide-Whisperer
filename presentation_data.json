    "detailed_summary": "In May 2023, Brian Chesky, co-founder of Airbnb, reflects on the journey of the company's first five years, emphasizing the importance of challenging the status quo and fostering a childlike curiosity. By June 2021, Airbnb had become the world's leading lodging marketplace with four million hosts offering seven million listings across 220 countries and regions. Despite the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, Airbnb remained profitable in the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. Founded in 2007 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk, Airbnb went public through a successful IPO. The early days of Airbnb saw Chesky and Gebbia inflating airbeds in their San Francisco apartment to fund their rent. They hosted three attendees during a design conference, challenging their assumptions about who would stay at a stranger's house. This experience gave them insight into the future of lodging and solidified their belief in the Airbnb model. The timeline of events includes significant milestones such as Blecharczyk joining as the technical lead in February 2008, the launch of AirBed&Breakfast during the Democratic National Convention in Denver in August 2008, and the addition of a PayPal payment feature to the site after Chesky's awkward payment experience. The early success of Airbnb was evident during the Denver convention, where the site attracted 800 listings and 80 bookings, offering a unique and cost-effective alternative to traditional hotels.",

    "detailed_summary": "By May 2011, Airbnb secures a significant funding round of $115 million at a valuation of $1.3 billion to fuel its growth and expansion into Germany and Europe. The company acquires Accoleo, a German Airbnb clone, leveraging its operations to establish a presence in key European markets. Chesky emphasizes the importance of opening local offices and hiring local teams, a strategy that propels Airbnb into becoming a primarily international business. The focus on integrating local culture and community engagement plays a pivotal role in Airbnb's transformation into a global travel network. In July 2011, Airbnb faces a critical incident when a host blogs about her apartment being trashed, highlighting a challenge in maintaining trust and safety within the platform. The company responds by launching an international professional photography service to enhance property listings. Throughout its early years, Airbnb's revenue model involved charging guests around 10% of their payment and hosts 3%, covering variable costs like payments and customer service.",

        "response": "p. 6\nAirbnb\n    And so you can imagine how we felt \u2013 and I think at that point we had done the round with Greylock\n    for $7 million and I also get a news report that this guy Oliver Samwer has raised $400 million,24\n    he has hired 400 people in like 30 days, set up 40 offices. I didn\u2019t know it was kind of possible \u2013 it\n    took Joe and I like 2 years to hire 40 people and he got 400 people in 30 days out of nowhere, and\n    he was going to create this company, and this company was going to be a clone of our company,\n    and he made no mistake about saying that we were an American company and he was going to out\u2011\n    localize us. At that point, we really started investigating, well, do we think this strategy is going to\n    work. And it became clear that there was one thing they did that worked very well, and that one\n    thing was that they actually had local people and local offices on the ground. We tested it ourselves\n    and we realized, oh crap \u2013 that actually works!\n    ... I end up going to Berlin in 2011, met with Samwer and\u2026 we realized that we had a decision to\n    make, and the decision was [between] Plan A and what we called Plan B. And Plan A was we retain\n    this global travel network by acquiring Wimdu. Because we visited them and they clearly had a ton\n    of traction. Or, we had Plan B. The problem is, we didn\u2019t know what Plan B was yet. And, we\u2019re\n    like, OK, we have to come up with plan B. And, even that night, we decided to do Plan B. We\n    decided to do plan B even though we had no Plan B\u2026 We don\u2019t know what Plan B is, but I\u2019d rather\n    pursue Plan B and maybe win, but maybe lose, than inherit this other company that we thought was\n    not mission\u2011based\u2026 because it wouldn\u2019t be Airbnb, and I wouldn\u2019t want to come to work for that\n    company, be part of that company... I\u2019d rather lose and keep our soul than win without it. And so\n    we said now we\u2019re basically, frankly fighting for our life to retain this global network. And I\n    thought we\u2019d win\u2026 In wars, missionaries typically beat mercenaries, and we knew like we did it\n    for the mission, we were willing to do it for the long term. I remember even Paul Graham telling\n    me\u2026 if you\u2019re in a race, they can sprint with you but they don\u2019t want to do the marathon. And I\n    think the community ultimately was the difference. I think we provide a much better product but\n    the community was that magic, the bottle that they were never able to crack. Our community loved\n    the experience, our employees loved working there, everything was mission\u2011driven and we really\n    agonized over every step of the [customer] experience, and people tried them, but it wasn\u2019t as good\n    an experience as ours\u202625\nMay-June 2011 \u2013 By May 2011, Airbnb raised less than $8 million in total.
